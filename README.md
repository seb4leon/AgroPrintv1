AgroPrint is an open digital tool for calculating the carbon footprint of agricultural products, based on common activities and following international standards (IPCC, PAS 2050). The current scope covers emissions "cradle-to-farm gate".

## Main Features
- Carbon footprint calculation for agricultural crops
- Emission factors aligned with IPCC and PAS 2050
- Exportable and visualizable results (CSV, XLSX)
- Designed for integration with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and as a Digital Public Good (DPG)
